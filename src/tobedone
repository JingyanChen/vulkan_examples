#### [Push constants](examples/pushconstants/)

Uses push constants, small blocks of uniform data stored within a command buffer, to pass data to a shader without the need for uniform buffers.


#### [Input attachments](examples/inputattachments)

Uses input attachments to read framebuffer contents from a previous sub pass at the same pixel position within a single render pass. This can be used for basic post processing or image composition ([blog entry](https://www.saschawillems.de/tutorials/vulkan/input_attachments_subpasses)).

#### [Sub passes](examples/subpasses/)

Advanced example that uses sub passes and input attachments to write and read back data from framebuffer attachments (same location only) in single render pass. This is used to implement deferred render composition with added forward transparency in a single pass.

#### [Offscreen rendering](examples/offscreen/)

Basic offscreen rendering in two passes. First pass renders the mirrored scene to a separate framebuffer with color and depth attachments, second pass samples from that color attachment for rendering a mirror surface.

#### [Shadow mapping](examples/shadowmapping/)

Rendering shadows for a directional light source. First pass stores depth values from the light's pov, second pass compares against these to check if a fragment is shadowed. Uses depth bias to avoid shadow artifacts and applies a PCF filter to smooth shadow edges.
